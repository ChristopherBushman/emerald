  Terraform is a simple software tool that uses high-level configuration language to provision software infrastructure. This week, I used Terraform to deploy cloud infrastructure over AWS to be used in conjunction with Ansible playbooks in order to create and connect webservers in various subnets.
  Terraform uses a high-level configuration language that is easy for humans to understand and works well with machines. In this way, it is similar to Ansible. However, Ansible has certain (and tedious) syntax requirements that Terraform does not. Furthermore, Ansible's main purpose is configuring whereas Terraform's main purpose is structuring. 
  Creating a VPC using Terraform seemed daunting at first. But after some trial and error, the task was completed. To set up the VPC using Terraform, the provider must first be established. In this case, the provider is Amazon AWS in AWS's "us-west-2" region. Translated into a .tf file, the provider looks like this:
  
  ```
  provider "aws" {
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
  ```

  Creating the VPC and corresponding subnets however takes a bit more thinking. Terraform provides various "resources" that can be incorporated into the .tf file's code. One of these resources is "aws_vpc" and is used to set up a virtual private cloud on AWS.
  
  ```
  resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/20"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support = true
  }
  ```
  
  yes
