CodeCommit is a service that is very similar to GitHub and is used for storing code and data. It even works using GIT tools already installed on a machine! CodeCommit will be used over the length of this semester to store the source code of my term project. Today, I talk about how i set up a pipeline in CodePipeline (another AWS service, useful with automation).

Creating a repository through CodeCommit is fairly easy. Simply navigate to the CodeCommit service on Amazon AWS, choose a region and a name, and click create. I then cloned the repository to my local machine using the following command:

  ```
  git clone ssh://git-codecommit.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/RepoName
  ```
  
An empty repository does not do me much good. I added sample code to my repo by creating a file on my local machine's repository and then using a git commit and git push to update the CodeCommit repository.
  
  ```
  git add -A
  git commit -m "sample code"
  git push
  ```
  
All of this was pretty easy and straightforward. Creating the EC2 instance to connect to my CodeCommit correctly however took trial and error. The main issue was understanding what to enter into the "User data" field of the "Configure Instance Details" step of launching the EC2. In my case, I ended up installing ruby, the AWS CLI, and CodeDeploy. The following script was used to accomplish these tasks:

  ```
  #!/bin/bash
yum -y update
yum install -y ruby
yum install -y aws-cli
cd /home/ec2-user
aws s3 cp s3://aws-codedeploy-us-east-2/latest/install . --region us-east-2
chmod +x ./install
./install auto
  ```
