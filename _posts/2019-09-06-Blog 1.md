  An important step in expanding one's knowledge on any given subject matter is retouching on the basics every once in a while. This week, I set up a LAMP stack. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. These are the four basic building blocks of creating a free, simple website. Going further, the simple website was modified using the Affinity repository. After installing and configuring each of these softwares, the initial website is up and running locally on the device where it was built. This can be changed so that the rest of the world can visit the website of course, but that was unnecessary for the purpose of this exercise.
  
  Taking this one step further, the whole process of creating the website was done inside of a Docker container. A Dockerfile is a text file containing all of the commands necessary for a base image to be assembled. The Dockerfile in this exercise contains a set of instructions for the computer to follow in order to install LAMP and get the basic website up and running. The main benefit of doing this is automation. Manually entering commands into the command line can get repetetive and takes time. On the other hand, running this Dockerfile only takes one single command and streamlines the process.
