  Javascript is a powerful tool that can be used on top of HTML and CSS to provide an advanced and interactive environment on a given webpage. I had the opportunity this week to use Javascript on a webpage that I had already created previously and get an understanding of how to use the language to give the website some extra functionality.
  
  First thing first: How do you use Javascript on a file that is written in HTML? There are a couple of options to solve this conundrum. One option is to add Javascript code within a <script> tag. For example, if a webpage needs to have a pop-up window displaying today's date and the current time, an HTML file using Javascript would look like this:
  
  ```
  <script>
     var date = new Date()
     alert("Today's date is " + date);
  </script>
  ```
  Here, the variable "date" is created and populated with the date object. This practice of inserting Javascript into HTML can be used for a multitude of purposes and functions. For the sake of clarity however, I opted to put my Javascript code into a separate file that would then be linked to the HTML page. This makes the HTML code look cleaner and makes the website more modular. Using this practice, I created a separate file in the same directory as my HTML files and named it "script.js". After putting all of the Javascript into this file, it is just a matter of adding the source .js file to the HTML page. 
  ```
  <script src = "script.js"></script>
  ```
  Unlike the languages with which Javascript is working with (HTML and CSS), Javascript can contain functions that complete a complex action. Look at the array below:
  ```
  var names;
  names = ["Melony", "Carl", "Alyssa", "Jeff"];
  
  console.log("Initial output: ", names);
  
  names.shift();
  console.log("Resulting array: ", names);
  ```
  In this simple function, the array "names" is created and populated with the four names "Melony, Carl, Alyssa, Jeff" and its contents are outputted to the console (for testing purposes), which can be accessed on any modern web browser. The line "names.shift();" actually takes an action on the array. The first object inside of the array is eliminated and all other objects are shifted to the left. The resulting array is outputted to the console, resulting in the following:

  These are just a few simple examples of the functionality of Javascript within a webpage. In the coming weeks, I will be delving deeper into the language and using Javascript to perform more complex actions.
