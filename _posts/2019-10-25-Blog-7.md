  Javascript is a powerful tool that can be used on top of HTML and CSS to provide an advanced and interactive environment on a given webpage. I had the opportunity this week to use Javascript on a webpage that I had already created previously and get an understanding of how to use the language to give the website some extra functionality. 
  First thing first: How do you use Javascript on a file that is written in HTML? There are a couple of options to solve this conundrum. One option is to add Javascript code within a <script> tag. For example, if a webpage needs to have a pop-up window displaying today's date, the HTML file using Javascript would look like this:
     <script>
        var date = new Date()
        alert("Today's date is " + date);
     </script>
