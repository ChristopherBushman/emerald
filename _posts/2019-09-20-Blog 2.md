  This week dealt with experimenting with a software called Ansible. Ansible is an IT automation software that is primarily used for application deployment and configuration management across multiple computers, operating systems or virtual machines. This is useful because it reduces monotonous, redundant labor that can easily be mitigated through automation. In addition to just using Ansible, Docker containers were used to use and test the software. Using docker containers saves massive amounts of system resources as opposed to using individual virtual machines. Running 5 virtual machines and pushing out operations to each of them would kill my poor laptop. Containers however come a dime a dozen comparatively. That is, 5 Docker containers use a fraction of the amount of system resources that 5 virtual machines would running simultaneously. 
  Ansible works by creating what are known as playbooks. A playbook is a set of plays, each of which are a set of instructions for an operation. Each play is written in a simple language called YAML, which is very easy for humans to understand. This week, I used Ansible to fulfill the same objective that I used Docker to accomplish last week: installing LAMP and composer. In addition, this first playbook clones the affinity repository. A second playbook was created to install traceroute and create system users with corresponding user/admin privileges.
