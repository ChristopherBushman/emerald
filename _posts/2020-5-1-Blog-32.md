AWS CodeCommit is a service that hosts Git repositories. This tool is used for monitoring changes to code hosted in repositories on Github. I am using CodeCommit to allow a website to update in real time from one of these repositories. The code is written in Terraform in order to allow for the automatic distribution of the website I referred to in a previous blog. 

There are a few steps to automating this in Terraform. First an IAM user must be created and assigned the correct permissions (IAM Policy). In my case, the user needs to be assigned a role that would allow for CodeDeploy, the software that would deploy the changes to the website in code commit onto the EC2 instance. 

  ```
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "CodeDeploy" {
  role = "${aws_iam_role.ec2.role.name}"
  policy_arn = "${arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCodeCommitFullAccess}"
}
  ```
