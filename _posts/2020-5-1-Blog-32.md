AWS CodeCommit is a service that hosts Git repositories. This tool is used for monitoring changes to code hosted in repositories on Github. I am using CodeCommit to allow a website to update in real time from one of these repositories. The code is written in Terraform in order to allow for the automatic distribution of the website I referred to in a previous blog. 

There are a few steps to automating this in Terraform. First an IAM user must be created and assigned the correct permissions (IAM Policy). In my case, the user needs to be assigned a role that would allow for CodeDeploy, the software that would deploy the changes to the website in code commit onto the EC2 instance. 

  ```
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "CodeDeploy" {
  role = "${aws_iam_role.ec2.role.name}"
  policy_arn = "${arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCodeCommitFullAccess}"
}
  ```

The most challenging part of this process for me was figuring out how to generating the HTTPS Git credentials that CodeCommit would need in order to communicate with the Github repository that the website relies on. The problem was that Terraform has not resource for performing such a task automously. At this point, my best work around for this is to use a script external to the Terraform that would do this through the EC2 CLI.

  ```
data "external" "Credscript" {
  count = "${local.is_pcs_dev}"
  program = ["${path.root}/credscript.sh"]
}

resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "credscript_cc_id" {
   name = "${local.credscript}/codecommit_https_user"
   value = "${lookup(data.external.credscript.result, "ServiceUserName", "")}"
}

resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "credscript_cc_p" {
   name = "${local.credscript}/codecommit_https_pass"
   value = "${lookup(data.external.credscript.result, "ServicePassword", "")}"
}
  ```

After this, CodeCommit must clone the Github repository.
