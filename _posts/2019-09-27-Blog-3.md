  Ansible is an IT automation software used for configuration management and application development across multiple virtual machines. This saves copious amounts of repetitive labor and resources. I used a Docker container to test Ansible on. Ansible uses .yml files (written in YAML) for building and running playbooks. Playbooks are simply sets of instructions (plays) that are executed to perform configuration management and multi-machine deployment. 
  
  For example, installing traceroute on an ubuntu machine would normally consist of a simple terminal command: sudo apt-get install inetutils-traceroute. In a playbook written in YAML, the equivalent play looks like this:
- name: install traceroute
   apt:
     name: inetutils-traceroute
     state: latest
    
 In this example, "install traceroute" is the name of the instruction to be executed. The name does not have to be anything specific to the instruction being executed. Rather, it is simply a label so that humans understand what the instruction is for when looking over the code. "apt" manages apt packages. This is equivalent to apt-get. The following "name" is not a simple label like the first. "inetutils-traceroute" tells ansible that the software to be installed is called inetutils-traceroute, or in other words the traceroute package. "state" tells ansible the desired state of configuration for the package being installed. In this case, the latest state of traceroute is desired.
