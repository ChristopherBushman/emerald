Title: Blog 29

As I have mentioned in previous blogs, AWS instances can be fully automated. They can be created, configured, launched and terminated automatically if we choose to do so. This week, I had the opportunity to practice one more tidbit of automation: auto-scaling.

Auto-scaling is AWS's method of automatically deploying and terminating new instances based on need. For example, a popular web application may have far more users during the daytime than it would at night. Auto-scaling allows for more instances, and thus more computing resources, to be available for use. At night, those extra instances are removed since their extra resources are not needed. The idea here is to automatically determine need and reduce costs autonomously.
